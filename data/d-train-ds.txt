CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion that generates real-time, single-line or full-function code suggestions in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to help you quickly build software. With CodeWhisperer, you can write a comment in natural language that outlines a specific task in English, such as “Upload a file with server-side encryption.” Based on this information, CodeWhisperer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the IDE that can accomplish the task. You can quickly and easily accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. You should always review a code suggestion before accepting them, and you may need to edit it to ensure it does exactly what you intended. CodeWhisperer helps accelerate software development by providing code suggestions that reduce total development effort and allow more time for ideation, complex problem solving, and writing differentiated code. In addition to general purpose code suggestions, CodeWhisperer has additional training to provide code suggestions for using AWS APIs. CodeWhisperer can also help you improve application security by helping detect and remediate security vulnerabilities. As you are writing code, CodeWhisperer analyzes the English language comments and surrounding code to infer what code is needed to complete the task at hand. CodeWhisperer suggests one or more code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating you as you code. The code suggestions provided by CodeWhisperer are based on a large language models (LLMs) trained on billions of lines of code, including Amazon and open-source code. You can quickly and more easily accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. Always review a code suggestion before accepting it, and you may need to edit it to ensure that it does exactly what you intended. Trained on billions of lines of Amazon and publicly available code, Amazon CodeWhisperer understands comments written in natural language (in English) and can generate multiple code suggestions in real time to improve developer productivity. The service suggests entire functions and logical blocks of code (often consisting of up to 10–15 lines of code) directly in the integrated development environments (IDE) code editor. The generated code is similar to how you would write code, matching your style and naming conventions. You can quickly accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. Always review a code suggestion before accepting them, and you may need to edit it to ensure that it does exactly what you intended. As you type, CodeWhisperer even provides suggestions to complete the comment itself. Amazon CodeWhisperer provides artificial intelligence (AI)–powered code suggestions for multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL, and Scala. You can use the service from multiple IDEs, including JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and Rider), Visual Studio (VS) Code, AWS Cloud9, AWS Lambda console, JupyterLab and Amazon SageMaker Studio. CodeWhisperer makes it more efficient for developers to use AWS services by providing code suggestions that are optimized for AWS APIs including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). As you write code in your IDE, CodeWhisperer automatically analyzes your code and comments. It makes a suggestion using the relevant cloud services and public software libraries for the desired functionality, and then it recommends code snippets that meet AWS best practices. With CodeWhisperer, you can scan Java, JavaScript, and Python projects to detect hard-to-find vulnerabilities, such as those in the top 10 Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) or those that don't meet crypto library best practices and other similar security best practices. The service analyzes existing code in the IDE (whether generated by CodeWhisperer or written by you), identifies problematic code with high accuracy, and provides intelligent suggestions on how to remediate it. CodeWhisperer provides a built-in reference tracker that detects whether a code suggestion might resemble open-source training data and can flag such suggestions. These suggestions are annotated with the open-source project’s repository URL, file reference, and license information so that you can review before deciding whether to incorporate the suggested code. All flagged suggestions that you used are logged so that you can review later and add license attribution at your discretion. You can also opt to filter out all code suggestions that CodeWhisperer determines resemble open-source code. Responsible use of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies is key to fostering continued innovation. CodeWhisperer helps developers avoid bias by filtering out code suggestions that might be considered biased and unfair. Provide users or groups access to CodeWhisperer using single sign-on (SSO) with AWS IAM Identity Center integration. Manage group-wide policies, such as including suggestions with referenced code.
